# iOS TimerApp

The first Pomodoro app as simple as the task. Sure, for free.

This project was born with the idea of creating a tool that I already use on a daily basis. As soon as I saw the “in-app purchases” in each of the apps in the App Store, I dismissed the idea of installing an existing one, so I decided to create it myself.
